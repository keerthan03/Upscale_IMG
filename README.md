# Image Super-Resolution using TensorFlow Lite Model

This project demonstrates how to upscale images using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for super-resolution.

## Introduction

Super-resolution is a technique used to enhance the resolution and quality of an image beyond its original dimensions. This project utilizes a TensorFlow Lite model, which is optimized for deployment on mobile and edge devices.

## Usage

### Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- TensorFlow Lite (>=2.0)
- Pillow (PIL Fork)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub pillow
```

## Instructions

Download the TensorFlow Lite Model:

- Download the pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for super-resolution. You can obtain this model from a trusted source or train your own model.

- Load the Model: Load the TensorFlow Lite model using the tf.lite.Interpreter.

- Preprocess the Image: Preprocess the input image to match the input size expected by the model.

- Perform Inference: Use the loaded model to perform inference on the preprocessed image.
  
- Post-process the Output: Post-process the output tensor to obtain the upscaled image.
